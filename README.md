# DSCI-560-Lab3
By the end of this lab, you will be able to: 
1. Write and execute a C program performing large matrix operations on a CPU. 
2. Measure CPU execution performance with different matrix sizes. 
3. Port the program to CUDA and execute it on a GPU. 
4. Deploy a GPU-enabled virtual machine on Google Cloud and run CUDA programs. 
5. Optimize CUDA code for better GPU performance. 
6. Compare performance results between CPU, naïve CUDA, optimized CUDA, and 
cuBLAS implementations. 
7. Analyze performance scaling as the problem size grows. 
8. Create shared libraries using CUDA and make use of the acceleration from Python.
